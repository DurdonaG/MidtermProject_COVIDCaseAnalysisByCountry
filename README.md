# COVID- 19 pandemic analysis by countries 

## Background:

The Covid-19 has impacted every aspect of peopleâ€™s livelihood around the world. This pandemic has led to new cases and deaths every day for over an year. While this is a global pandemic, the number of cases and deaths differ for every country. We have decided to measure total cases, new cases, and total deaths in selected countries to find a trend for the pandemic as well as to find an association with the government policies using Stringency Index.

Stringency Index is a composite measure of nine of the response metrics. The nine metrics used to calculate the Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls.

### Business Question:
What is the trend of Covid-19 pandemic in the following countries: United States, Russia, Italy, South Korea, United Kingdom, and India? How does government policies affect the new cases and deaths in these countries? 
    
### Data Question	
Is stringency index correlated with how Covid-19 cases evolved in selected countries? Is there any correlation between human development index in the country and how many cases the country had per 1M?

### Analysis

Graph shows that there was a significant increase of new cases in October due to the cluster infections in vulnerable facilities. As the South Korean government implemented new policies such as night curfew and limiting gatherings of 5 or more people in January, we were able to see a decline of new cases.
