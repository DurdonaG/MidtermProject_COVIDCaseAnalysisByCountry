# COVID- 19 pandemic analysis by countries 

## Background:

The Covid-19 has impacted every aspect of peopleâ€™s livelihood around the world. This pandemic has led to new cases and deaths every day for over an year. While this is a global pandemic, the number of cases and deaths differ for every country. We have decided to measure total cases, new cases, and total deaths in selected countries to find a trend for the pandemic as well as to find an association with the government policies using Stringency Index.

Stringency Index is a composite measure of nine of the response metrics. The nine metrics used to calculate the Stringency Index are: school closures; workplace closures; cancellation of public events; restrictions on public gatherings; closures of public transport; stay-at-home requirements; public information campaigns; restrictions on internal movements; and international travel controls.
